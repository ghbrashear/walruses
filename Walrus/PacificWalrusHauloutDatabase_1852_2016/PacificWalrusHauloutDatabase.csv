Haulout description:  
Amak Island is an uninhabited island north of the western tip of the Alaska Peninsula, 18 km offshore from Izembek Lagoon. Walrus haulout sites have been reported along the east, southeast and southwest coasts of the island (USFWS, unpublished).

History of use:
Amak Island is a historically important haulout area for Pacific walruses with sighting records dating back to the 1800U+0027s (Tanner 1892, Fay 1957).  Little to no walrus haulout activity was reported at Amak Island in the first half of the 20th Century (Fay 1957). Intermittent sightings of walruses hauled out on Amak Island were reported in the 1960U+0027s and regular use by groups of walruses ranging in size from tens to hundreds of animals was reported in the late 1970U+0027s (Frost and others 1982).  In a letter to Ken Taylor of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game dated 10 January 1985, the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge reported numerous sightings of up to 500 live walruses based on aerial, dory and ground surveys of Amak Island during 1979, with a peak count on 28 June 1979 and continued sightings through 6 September 1979.  The letter also reports that a 7 May 1980 aerial survey found no walruses present.  On 3 June 2015 two local fishermen reported sighing some 300 walruses hauled out on the beach in a cove of the southeast side of the island and reported the sighting to A. Miller, Supervisory Park Ranger, Togiak National Wildlife Refuge two days later.  The two fishermen indicated that they had traveled past the island close enough to make sightings four times a year during the previous 9 years and had never previously observed walruses.

Historical Use:  
Use is well known during the 19th Century (Suvorov 1914, Arsen'ev 1927).   Active use by walruses has been reported throughout most of the 20th Century (Razumovsky 1931, Belopol'sky 1939, Zenkovich 1938, Nikulin 1941, Krylov and others 1964, Geller 1957, Kleinenberg and others 1964, Somov and others 1982, Krylov 1968, Gol'tsev 1968, Gol'tsev 1972, Estes and Gol'tsev 1984, Kibal'chich 1978, Kibal'chich 1988, Kibal'chich 1979, Fedoseev 1981, Mymrin and others 1990, Mymrin and others 1988, Fedoseev and Razlivalov 1986, Mymrin 1991, Grachev and Mymrin 1991, Kruse 1995, Zheleznov-Chukotsky and others 2003).   Declines in use were noted in the early and mid-20th century (Krylov 1951).  Nikulin (1941) noted that use during the 1930's became sparse, and Krylov (1951) indicated that use declined after 1946 and became restricted to autumn use.  The maximum haulout count within recent decades was noted on 2 September 1990 by Kruse (1995) as 10,000 walruses based on unpublished data from the Provideniya Fisheries Inspection.  In 2000's only small numbers of walruses have been reported by local hunters (oral communication to A.A. Kochnev of ChukotTINRO). During visits to the island during July of 2009 and 2010 Ovsyanikov reported approximately 100 and 126 walruses respectively; but only 3 walruses during a 15 August 2010 visit (Ovsyanikov 2012). During late July of 2011 Novoye Chaplino hunters observed up to 600 walruses resting here, although periodic observation efforts throughout late August and September of 2011 resulted in no observations of walruses on shore here (Kochnev 2012).  Fay (1982) indicates use by male walruses in July.  During the 1975 aerial survey effort Gol'tsev (1976) reported use by up to tens of thousands of walruses during 17 September through 16 October and Estes, and Gol'tsev (1984) provide an estimate of that approached 42 thousand on 21 September 1975 based on extrapolations from areal and density estimates combined with individual counts.",4,"At least 10,000 and fewer than 100,000 walruses",2010,"Predominately males",0,0,1,1,0

Cape Lisburne is a prominent cape 65km north of Point Hope.  Walruses utilize several haulout sites along northern rocky coastline of Cape Lisburne. The most consistently used haulout site is immediately adjacent to the runway serving the Long Range Radar Station (Known locally as First Beach). Walruses have also been reported at small pocket beaches west of runway (Kittiwake Beach and Grizzly Bear Beach), and along the rocky shoreline at the NW tip of the Cape. 

History of use:
Cape Lisburne is a historically significant haulout site with recorded use dating back to the start of the previous century (Bernard 1923; Fay 1957). Fay and others (1984), report that the site was re-occupied in the 1970's after approximately 30 years of disuse. US Fish and Wildlife Service Maritime National Wildlife Refuge biologists conducting seabird surveys at Cape Lisburne reported regular use of Cape Lisburne walrus haulout sites in the mid-1970's through late 1990's. Groups of walruses (30-500 animals), were commonly observed on area beaches from mid-July through September (Frost and others 1983). In the early 2000's, Long Range Radar Station staff reported sightings of groups of up to several thousand animals (predominately female walruses and their dependent young) hauled out on area beaches for periods ranging from a few days up to several weeks (David Roseneau of the US Fish and Wildlife Service Maritime National Wildlife Refuge written communication to USFWS 2004).  Point Hope residents confirm regular use of Cape Lisburne haulout sites in recent years (Huntington and Quakenbush 2013).  Local walrus hunters note that the number of animals using the Cape Lisburne haulout sites vary from day to day and from year to year; some years thousands of animals are seen; in other years numbers are substantially lower (Ronald Oviok Sr. of the Eskimo Walrus Commission oral communication to J. Garlich-Miller of the USFWS, 2013).  In 2014 the Alaska Sea Life Center placed an automated camera system near First Beach, and observed 15 walruses on shore together on 16 September 2014 (Johnathan Snyder of the USFWS written communication to A.S. Fischbach 31 March 2015).  USGS tracked numerous walruses past Cape Lisburne during the 2014 autumn migration, and indicated that two hauled out at Cape Lisburne (walrus 721 hauled out and shucked her tag at 18:00 UTC on  23 August 2014, and walrus 749 hauled out and shucked her tag at 14:00 UTC on 6 September 2014).  Both haulouts appear to have occurred very near the western-most point of Cape Lisburne, 2.1 statute miles west of the end of the airstrip and 1.38 statute miles west of the vehicle trails visible in Google Earth images.  Many other USGS tracked walruses passed close to the cape, and several milled about foraging near to the cape.

Historical Use:  
Arsen'ev (1927) noted Cape Schmidt as a large haulout in the end of 19th century or begin of the 20th century.  During the early 1930's a large urban settlement was built near the site of the haulout, which may have contributed to the lack of observed haulout use until Kavry and others (2008) note the formation of a large haulout of more 40,000 walruses in September of 2007 (Kochnev 2012).  Thereafter (2007 -2014), regular use has been reported, though not every year, with counts approaching 50,000 (Semenova and others 2010, Kochnev 2012, Pereverzev and Kochnev 2012, Maksim Deminov written communication and photograph 2014).  The haulout has been used by both adult males and by females and young, with the females and young replacing the adult males on the haulout as the season progresses from August through October (Semenova and others 2010, Pereverzev and Kochnev 2012).  Overall, the age-sex composition is about 10% male, similar to the Wrangel Island haulouts.  During the 2011 haulout large number of walruses of calves of the year and older age classes of both sexes were found dead (n = 123), and the deaths were attributed to both trampling and falls down steep rocking slopes, with polar bears playing a role (Pereverzev and Kochnev 2012, Kochnev 2012).",4,"At least 10,000 and fewer than 100,000 walruses",2010,"Predominately females and dependent calves",0,0,1,1,0

Historical Use:  
Use prior to 1927 is noted by Arsen'ev (1927). Nikulin (1941) noted use by walruses in 1937. Regularly use by walruses in ice-free autumns during all of the 20th Century up to the present (Belopl'skii 1939, Grachev and Mymrin, 1991; Zheleznov-Chukotsky and others, 2003; Kochnev, 2010b, unpublished data).

In early October of 1975 Estes and Gol'tsev (1984) used extrapolation from aerial and density estimates to enumerate between 9 and 12 thousand walruses.  The 1990 aerial survey indicated more than 12 thousand walruses on 30 September (Gilbert and others, 1992).

Historical Use:
First noted by Arsen'ev (1927) and Nikulin (1941). The cape was generally not used from the 1930's to the middle of 1990's, with only occasional use by some 600 walruses in 1964 on the Karkarpko Island (Goltsev 1968, Kavry and others 2006). From the late 1990's to present it received regular use (Kochnev 2004, Kavry and others 2006, Kavry and others 2008, Kochnev and others, 2008b; Kryukova and Kochnev 2012).  Walrus begin using the site during ice-free conditions beginning in September and extending into the November (Kavry and others 2006).  Estimates in excess of 35,000 made in October of 2010 by Chukot TINRO (N. Kryukova, unpublished data).  
Estimates in excess of 16,000 made in September of 2011 (Kryukova and Kochnev 2011, Kochnev 2012).  Observations on the composition of the haulout during 2011 indicate that use of the haulout shifts from predominately males to predominantly females and young during the course of the haulout season (August through October; Kochnev 2012).

History of use:
Irregular sighting of walruses on the barrier islands between the communities of Point Lay and Wainwright were reported during the 1950's-1980's by pilots and community residents (Frost and others 1983, Huntington and others 2013, Walt Audi oral communication to USFWS, 2013). Since 2007, the barrier island  across the Kasegaluk lagoon from the community of Point Lay has seen regular use by large herds of walruses in the autumn (August-October) during sea ice-free conditions. In August 2007, aerial surveys recorded a large haulout of more than 1,500 animals just north of the village (Ireland and others, 2009). Large herds were also recorded during September through October of 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014 (Clarke and others, 2011, Clarke and others, 2013, Clarke and others, 2014). Monson and others (2013) documented approximately 30,000 animals along a 1 km stretch of beach near Point Lay on 26 August, 2011.  On 27 September of 2014, the NOAA Aerial Surveys of Arctic Marine Mammals estimated a similar number (on the order of 35 thousand) of walruses on the barrier island approximately 6 nautical miles north of the abandoned village of Point Lay (ASAMM-Chukchi  Flight 240  27 September 2014, Clarke and others, 2014).  This site appears to be one of the most consistently used walrus haulout areas in the north eastern Chukchi Sea in recent years.

Additional aerials counts of 700-800 walruses on 22 September 2014,  1,166 walruses on 30 October 20-14, and 103 walruses on 18 November 2014 are reported by the Izembek NWR (Lowe 2015).   We classified this haulout as a predominantly male haulout based on examination of photographs that revealed only adult walruses and the general understanding that only male walruses occupy the southwestern Bering Sea during ice-free seasons.

The cape is 7 nautical miles north of the mouth to Ugashik Bay.   The haulout location coincides with the prominent sandy area atop the bluff and is situated along the beach at the easternmost side of the high bluff.

Historical Use:  During early March of 2016 Alaska Peninsula National Wildlife Refuge Wildlife Biologist D. Watts repeatedly observed walruses hauling out on the beach during overflights.  All walruses present appeared to be male.  Watts estimated 120 walruses on shore on 4 March, 120 on 5 March, and 50-70 on 16 March 2016 (written communication to A.S. Fischbach).   Photos taken by D. Watts on 5 April 2016 indicate more than 1,100 walruses (photo count from written communication to A.S. Fischbach).  Photos taken on 21 April 2016 by J. King of King Air in Naknek/King Salmon indicate approximately 1,500 walruses present in two groups along the beach separated by approximately 40 yards.  Photos taken by USGS Wildlife Biologist S. Schoen on the morning and evening of 3 May 2016 indicate at least 3,000 walruses present (based on a complete count of stitched photos, USGS unpublished data).  On 29 May 2016 photo counts indicated approximately 1,000 walrueses hauled out on shore with many more in the surf and adjacent waters (D. Watts / A.SS. Fischbach unpublished data).  Public testimony from a Dillingham resident during an April 2016 public meeting with the FWS Togiak National Wildlife Refuge manager, A.

The Punuk Islands are a chain of three small islets in the northern Bering Sea off the eastern end of St. Lawrence Island. Walrus haulouts have been documented on all three islands; the two northern-most islands are used most extensively (Perry Pungowiyi of Savoonga oral communication to J. Garlich-Miller, 2013).

History of use:
Elliot (1886) indicated the presence of more than 150 male walruses hauling out here during August of 1874.  Murie (1936) indicated that no walruses had hauled out here during the 1920's, but that use began again during the 1930's.  Mr. Lawrence Kuluknon, who resided near the Punuk islands (1916-1942) noted an unusual mortality event and large numbers of walruses during two autumns between 1930 and 1932.  Fay and Kelly (1980) note that L. Kulukon indicated that during these autumns the haulout atained an extent similar to that documented in 1978 when an estimated 50-60 thousand walruses were present, but that no such large haulout occurred again during his residnce.   Shiller (1954) recounts the observation of Savoonga resident, Irwing Ifkuluk's, account of 54 carcasses being found here in the spring of 1949.  Murie (1936) recounts local observations of walruses found crushed onshore here during the spring of 1935.  Frost and others (1982) report that the Punuk Islands were used intermittently in the 1950's-1970's by ""hundreds"" of walruses.  Large herds (up to several thousand animals) were observed most years in the 1970's and 1980's. Fay and Kelly (1980) documented a mass mortality event at the Punuk island in 1978. They estimated that between 50-60,000 walruses occupied the Punuk Islands during October through November of 1978. Regular use of the islands has been reported since the 1980's by up to several thousand walruses of mixed age and sex classes in late autumn (October through December) most years (Perry Pungowiyi of Savoonga oral communication to J.

Historical Use:  
Use was first noted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Suvorov (1914). During the 20th century this spit received use nearly every year by male walruses that established the haulout by the end of June (Arsen'ev 1927, Zenkovich 1938, Belopol'sky 1939, Nikulin 1941, Pikharev 1943 unpublished report, Geller 1957, Yablokov and Bel'kovich 1962, Krylov and others 1964, Kleinenberg and others 1964, Krylov 1966, Krylov 1968, Mymrin and Grachev 1986, Grachev 1988, Mymrin and others 1988, Mymrin and others 1990, Grachev and Mymrin 1991, Krylov 2001, Kochnev 2004). Use is well known and monitoring efforts have been conducted by ChuktTINRO and the ""Haulout Keepers"" project (Smirnov and others 2002, Pereverzev 2006, Kochnev and others 2008, Kryukova and others 2010, Kochnev 2012).  Use was noted during the 1960, 1964, 1975, 1980, 1985 and 1990 aerial surveys (Fedoseev 1966,  Gol'tsev 1968, Fedoseev 1981, Estes and Gol'tsev 1984, Fedoseev and Razlivalov 1986,  Gilbert and others 1992).  In October of 1990 aerial survey efforts reported 255 animals here (Gilbert and others 1992).  Additional haulouts have been observed near Retkyn Spit including (1) Kaymatkyn Bay, which is described as a separate haulout record; (2) Cape Ivyrgyn, which is described under the Kaymatkyn Bay haulout record; and (3) Cape Chirikova, which is described under the Kaymatkyn Bay haulout record (see Kochnev 2012 for details).  

Between 1980 and 2000 numbers of walruses on the Retkyn Spit often exceeded 10,000: 
12,000 in 1980 (Fedoseev, 1981); 
24,000 in 1983 (Grachev, 1988);

Walruses primarily haulout along the beaches on the east and west sides of the narrow ridge on the north side of the island, as well as several pocket beaches on the east of the island.  Round Island is part of the Walrus Islands State Game Sanctuary in northern Bristol Bay, established in 1960 by the Alaska Legislature (Alaska Statute 16.20.090).  Since 1989, all access to Round Island and its surrounding waters within a three mile radius requires an access permit issued by the ADF&G, Division of Wildlife Conservation (Alasks State Regulation 5AAC 92.066).  In addition, restrictions have been placed on visitor numbers and their activities in order to preserve the important resources at Round Island (Alaska Administrative Code 5 AAC 92.066).

History of use:
The Walrus Islands are a historically important haulout area for Pacific walruses, with sighting records dating back to the 1800's (Korsakovskiy 1818 in VanStone 1988, Fay 1957, Frost and others 1982).  Archaeological work indicates use by native Alaskans associated with walrus hunting back to almost 6,000 years before present (Schaaf, 2015).   Round Island is the most consistently used terrestrial haulout site in Bristol Bay.  Annual monitoring reports may be found on-line through the Alaksa Resource Library and Information Service (http://www.arlis.org/docs/vol1/RoundIsland/713905939etc.html).  The Island is typically occupied by adult male walruses from April through September, occasionally into October and November, with peak use usually occurring during July and August.  Haulout use has been monitored annually by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game since the 1980's, with peak haulout counts ranging from 1,746 - 15,000 animals (Udevitz and others 2005, Weiss and Morrill 2013).
